*Father and son Walter and Jeff Cruttenden.  Walter the father was also a founder and ceo of the investment bank unit of E*TRADE (Investopedia)  



* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 

*Talking to his friends and piers Jeff Cruttenden found a niche on the financial services. Regular banks and other institutions didn’t provide any solution or the right vehicle for the majority of the millennial generation to save, invest and take the advantage of today markets to create wealth.  
The founders realized that there is a lot of potential investors in the millennial generation who stayed on the sideline because they felt they didn’t have the amount of money necessary to invest in the markets. 
They targeted this group providing them with a way to invest the same way they behave in their own lives; with the help of a Nobel Prize winner Dr Markowitz they devised a system to build a portfolio composed of a variety of index funds selected in concordance with the customer profile

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

*The lack of investment solutions, vehicles and tools the regular financial institutions have to serve the Millennial generation demand and access to the investment world. On top of the negative connotation and non-incentive, the investment markets have for the younger generation and regular people.
Is common knowledge that 70% of American’s don’t have a $1000 emergency fund setup and 66 % don’t have private savings for retirement. Basically, invest in a simple way without too much sacrifice and with no need of significant capital

* Who is the company's intended customer? 

*The clear customer target are the young investors who belong to the millennial generation. Plus, the universe of non-savvy investors who made between 50K and 60 K per year and reject the idea of talking to a classic financial advisor with car salesperson attitude.

*Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
*According to 2012 Time Magazine article the millennial population was estimated around 80 million, The United States Census Bureau estimated number of U.S. millennials in 2015 was 83.1 million people. They are expecting to have user base of 100 million people.
